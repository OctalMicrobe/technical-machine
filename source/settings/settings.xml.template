		If a directory is specified instead of a file, Technical Machine will
		randomly use a file inside that directory recursively. For instance, if
		you have team files in folders based on tiers, then to use any OU team
		you would put "teams/ou/", but to use your stall team you would put
		"teams/ou/stall.sbt".
	
		For directories, the terminating '/' is optional.

		Relative paths are relative to your executable, not this settings file.
