<h1>Technical Machine installation instructions</h1>

<p>For a full overview of the program, see http://doublewise.net/pokemon/</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>gcc version 4.6.0 or newer, with c++ support. gcc version 4.5.x and older will not work, as Technical Machine makes use of some feature in C++11 that are not supported in older versions of gcc. Listed as gcc-c++ in Fedora 15 repositories.</li>
<li>Boost. Listed as boost-devel in Fedora repositories.</li>
<li>fltk is needed for some non-core features, such as the stand-alone team predictor. Listed as fltk-devel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building</h2>

<ol>
<li>cd path/to/technical-machine</li>
<li>Create file.txt whenever you see file.txt.template.</li>
<li>Edit file.txt to replace ? entries with appropriate data, such as username and password.</li>
<li>run make. The default target (by simply typing make) will make the core program. Various stand-alone parts can be made by typing make target, where target is what you want to build. See makefile for exact target options. For an optimized build instead of a debug build, type make aio.</li>
<li>Run the program. If you made the default program, this is achieved by typing ./ai [depth], where depth is an optional value to search between 1 and 2 (higher numbers are too slow). Leaving depth blank sets depth to 2. For debugging, it is recommended to run the program through valgrind by running it as valgrind ./ai with a recommended depth of 1, but 2 is acceptable as well. If you made the optimized build (make aio), then you can set the depth to a value 1-3. The depth can be updated by sending a PM to the bot (if you are a trusted user, set in trusted_users.txt) with the command !depth #.</li>
</ol>

<h2>List of commands</h2>

<dl>
<dt>!challenge</dt>
<dd>Format is !challenge username</dd>
<dt>!depth</dt>
<dd>Format is !depth # (where # represents the new depth as an integer). Sets Technical Machine's depth of search to #. This only applies to future challenges / battles. Existing battles are set in their depth.</dd>
<dt>!join</dt>
<dd>Format is !join channel_name (with no '#' symbol)</dd>
<dt>!message</dt>
<dd>Sends a message to a channel. Format is !message channel_name msg where channel is a one word channel name (with no '#' symbol) and message is any number of words. For channels that may contain spaces, format is !message "channel name" msg</dd>
<dt>!part</dt>
<dd>Format is !part channel_name (with no '#' symbol)</dd>
<dt>!pm</dt>
<dd>Format is !pm username message where username is a one word username. For usernames that may contain spaces, format is !pm "user name" message</dd>
<dt>!reload</dt>
<dd>Reloads all relevant text files. This allows updating TM's set of canned responses, how often it uses those responses, and evaluation constants, for instance.</dd>
